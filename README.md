# GameMate

## :date: 27.3.2023 | Project kick-off

I started the GameMate project with a small prototyping session using Figma. I created prototypes for the application's login view, game sessions view, and user profile view.

Today I'm going to set up the development environment for the project and then start to work on the game sessions view. Possibly more prototyping with Figma too.
  
### Setting up the development environment  
  
* Created a new local Expo-project 'GameMate' and set https://github.com/lauritorma/GameMate.git as the remote origin. First commit done.  
* Installed Firebase to project 
* Installed React navigation to project  
* Created new app 'GameMate' in Firebase  
* Set up new Firebase Realtime Database
* Set up initial project structure and folders
* Added Firebase configuration object to ```config/firebaseConfig.js```  
* Added ```config/firebaseConfig.js``` to ```.gitignore```  


### Implementing three views and navigation between them  
  
Implemented navigation between "Games", "Create" and "Profile" screens with BottomTabNavigator
